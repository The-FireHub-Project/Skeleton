## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler.
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
  These fixes will be released as fast as possible to NPM.
